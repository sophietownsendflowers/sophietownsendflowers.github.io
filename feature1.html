					<h2>A Wedding Abroad</h2>
					<p>Anna and Paul’s spectacular hilltop wedding in sun-scorched Costa del Sol</p>
					<h2>The Venue</h2>

					<p>
						A stunning Spanish finca created the perfect setting for this laid back couple to
						tie the knot. Paul’s family live in Spain for part of the year and a relaxed holiday
						feel was just what this bride and groom were looking for. Paul and Anna fell in
						love with the beautiful views from this property and their friends who live there
						kindly offered to host the wedding for them.
					</p>
					<h2>The Theme</h2>
					<p>
						Anna wanted a tropical theme for the wedding with exotic blooms and vivid
						colours. Working to a tight budget, an early idea of a floral archway became a
						romantic gazebo inspired by a photo Anna had found in a magazine. As Paul is a
						skilled carpenter, he got straight to work putting together the wooden frame and
						this was elegantly draped in cream organza with floral arrangements attached
						either side.
					</p>
					<h2>The Flowers</h2>

					<p>
						Sophie worked with Anna and a Spanish florist to source the flowers close to
						the venue and flew over to prepare the flowers for the big day. To achieve the
						tropical feel within the budget, gerberas in a variety of hot pinks, oranges, reds
						and yellows were used throughout, with more expensive exotic flowers used
						sparingly to enhance the look. The bride’s hand-tied bouquet included colourful
						and white gerberas surrounded by palm fronds for a fresh tropical feel. Clusters
						of gerberas and peacock feathers in glass vases lined the long guest table and
						these worked perfectly with the tissue flowers Anna and her sister had made to
						decorate each place setting. For the ceremony, gerberas and peacock feathers
						adorned each chair row to make a flower-lined aisle up to the gazebo. The larger
						arrangements were predominantly a mixture of chrysanthemums and tropical
						blooms such as bird of paradise, heliconia and palm fronds.
					</p>
					<h2>Most Memorable Moment</h2>
