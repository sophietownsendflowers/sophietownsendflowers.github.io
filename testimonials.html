                                "Working with Sophie has been an absolute pleasure from start to finish. Every crazy idea that popped 
                                into my head she brought to life, in the most beautiful and elegant way. Nothing was ever too much trouble - 
                                from responding to my endless emails, to sourcing specific flowers that were not quite in season, to 
                                visiting the venues and going to endless car boot sales to find the right vintage vases and plates - 
                                the end result was stunning, and perfect for each of the venues and my wedding dress. I even got to keep 
                                the beautiful vintage swan vase which was the result of yet another one of my many emails over the months! 
                                Without a doubt, the flowers were my favourite part of planning our wedding - and I would not hesitate to 
                                work with Sophie again."

                                Thank you so much for all your hard work with the flowers. We couldn't believe how fabulous they were. They 
                                looked amazing in photographs. Everyone has complimented them.  They were exactly what I imagined and more.

								they looked and we were so sad to have to leave them behind we gave many of the table arrangements 
								away and I kept and dried the bouquets! The wedding would not have been the same without her.... 
								Thank you so much Sophie!"

								heart set on Lily of the Valley and although it was not in season, Sophie went all out to meet my 
								request. I am so proud of our wedding flowers and they still have the ‘wow’ factor when we show off 
								our photos."

								Sophie was instrumental in discussing and improving upon these and chose flowers that would work best 
								with our theme and within out budget, without compromising our wishes. The end result was more than we 
								could have ever wished for."

								"I couldn't be happier with the bouquet Sophie made for my wedding day. I do not know much about flowers 
								and I was able to simply show Sophie a picture of my dress and tell her the type and size of bouquet I 
								would like and she did the rest. The bouquet was simply gorgeous and felt wonderful to hold. It was not 
								until the next day, when I unraveled the flowers to save them, that I became aware of the real detail and 
								quality of the work."
