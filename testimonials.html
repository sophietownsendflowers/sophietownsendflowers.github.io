                            <p>"Working with Sophie has been an absolute pleasure from start to finish. Every crazy idea that popped into my head she brought to life, in the most beautiful and elegant way. Nothing was ever too much trouble from responding to my endless emails, to sourcing specific flowers that were not quite in season, to visiting the venues and going to endless car boot sales to find the right vintage vases and plates - the end result was stunning, and perfect for each of the venues and my wedding dress. I even got to keep the beautiful vintage swan vase which was the result of yet another one of my many emails over the months! Without a doubt, the flowers were my favourite part of planning our wedding - and I would not hesitate to work with Sophie again."</p><cite>Lanny</cite>

Many of our guests commented how amazing they looked and we were so sad to have to leave them behind we gave many of the table arrangements away and I kept and dried the bouquets! The wedding would not have been the same without her.... Thank you so much Sophie!"</p><cite>Alice - Kingston upon Thames</cite>

I had my heart set on Lily of the Valley and although it was not in season, Sophie went all out to meet my request. I am so proud of our wedding flowers and they still have the ‘wow’ factor when we show off our photos."</p><cite>Diane, Godalming</cite>

                            <p>"As our wedding was in Spain, we wanted a tropical, vibrant and fun theme.

The end result was more than we could have ever wished for."</p><cite>Anna - Poole</cite>

                            <p>"I couldn't be happier with the bouquet Sophie made for my wedding day. I do not know much about flowers and I was able to simply show Sophie a picture of my dress and tell her the type and size of bouquet I would like and she did the rest. The bouquet was simply gorgeous and felt wonderful to hold. It was not until the next day, when I unraveled the flowers to save them, that I became aware of the real detail and quality of the work."</p><cite>Dania, Guildford</cite>

                            <p>"Sophie went well beyond the call of duty in helping us prepare for our wedding day - as well as making beautiful bouquets, buttonholes and corsages, she went the extra mile - quite literally, to have the flowers delivered in time to our ceremony venue and also to our reception venue.  We were greeted by the sight of clusters of beautiful flowers on each table at our reception and were both absolutely delighted with the results.  Her calm, friendly and helpful approach throughout was very much appreciated and we couldn't recommend her enough!"</p><cite>Izzi, London</cite>
